# Frontend Demo

This folder contains example frontend components built with **React** and **TypeScript**. These are meant to demonstrate how portfolio analysis and trade history data could be visualized in a real application.

> These components are not wired to a live backend and are intended for display/demo purposes only.

### Files Included

- `PortfolioAnalysisIndex.tsx`: Renders portfolio exposure metrics for each account
- `TradeAnalysisPageIndex.tsx`: Displays accumulated options premiums from trade history data
- `ATHPortfolioIndex.tsx`: Shows all-time-high NAV submissions with evaluation logic

---

These components were used alongside `trade_analysis_utils.py` to power PDF generation and interactive dashboards.
